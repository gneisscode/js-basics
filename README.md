#6 statically typed languages are languages where the type of a variable is known at compile time. This usually means that you as the programmer must specify what type each variable is (e.g.: Java, C, C++) ,  A dynamically typed language is defined as such if the type is associated with run-time values, and not named variables/fields/etc. This means that you as a programmer do not have to specify types every time e.g JavaScript, Python, PHP.

#7 In JavaScript, undefined is a variable type, while null is an object. Undefined describes a variable which has been declared but has not been assigned any actual value. Whereas, null in JavaScript is an assignment value. You can assign it to a variable.
